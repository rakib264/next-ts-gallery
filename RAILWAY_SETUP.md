3. Add all the required variables listed above

### Step 4: Deploy
1. Railway will automatically deploy when you push to your repository
2. Check the **Deployments** tab for build logs
3. Check the **Logs** tab for runtime logs

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check Deployment Status
- Go to your Railway project
- Check that all services show "Deployed" status
- Look for any error messages in the logs

### 2. Test Environment Variables
You can run this command locally to test your environment:
```bash
cd railway-consumers
npm run validate-env
```

### 3. Test RabbitMQ Connection
```bash
cd railway-consumers
npm run debug
```

### 4. Check Logs
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Click on your consumer service
- Go to **Logs** tab
- Look for these success messages:
  ```
  ‚úÖ All required environment variables are set
  üîå Connecting to RabbitMQ...
  ‚úÖ Successfully connected to RabbitMQ
  ‚úÖ Invoice Generation consumer started successfully
  ‚úÖ New Order Creation consumer started successfully
  ```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "RABBITMQ_URL not configured"
**Solution:** Make sure you've added the `RABBITMQ_URL` variable to your consumer service, not just the RabbitMQ service.

### Issue 2: "SMTP configuration is incomplete"
**Solution:** Verify all SMTP variables are set correctly, especially `SMTP_USER` and `SMTP_PASS`.

### Issue 3: "Failed to connect to RabbitMQ"
**Solution:** 
1. Check that RabbitMQ service is running
2. Verify the `RABBITMQ_URL` format is correct
3. Make sure the URL includes username and password

### Issue 4: "Email transporter not initialized"
**Solution:**
1. Check SMTP credentials
2. Verify Gmail App Password is used (not regular password)
3. Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail account

## üìû Support

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Railway Logs:** Go to your service ‚Üí Logs tab
2. **Validate Environment:** Run `npm run validate-env`
3. **Test Connection:** Run `npm run debug`
4. **Check Vercel Logs:** Ensure your main app can connect to Railway RabbitMQ

## üîÑ Testing the Complete Flow

1. **Deploy to Railway:** Make sure consumers are running
2. **Deploy to Vercel:** Make sure main app has `RABBITMQ_URL` set
3. **Create Test Order:** Place an order on your website
4. **Check Logs:** Verify events are published and processed
5. **Check Emails:** Verify admin and customer emails are sent

Your RabbitMQ message queue should now work end-to-end! üéâ
