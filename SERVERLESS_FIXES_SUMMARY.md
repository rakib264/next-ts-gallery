# Serverless Environment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir 'logs'
**Problem**: Winston logger was trying to create a `logs` directory in Vercel's serverless environment, which has a read-only filesystem.

**Solution**: Created a serverless-compatible logger that only uses console transport in serverless environments.

### 2. 405 Method Not Allowed with Orders API
**Problem**: Orders API was failing due to Winston logger initialization issues when importing RabbitMQ services.

**Solution**: Made RabbitMQ service imports dynamic and conditional based on environment.

### 3. Startup API 500 Error
**Problem**: Startup API was trying to import consumer service which triggered logger initialization.

**Solution**: Made consumer service imports conditional and added proper error handling for serverless environments.

## Changes Made

### New Files Created

1. **`/lib/logger.ts`**
   - Serverless-compatible Winston logger factory
   - Detects serverless environment (Vercel)
   - Only uses console transport in serverless
   - Falls back gracefully if file transport creation fails

### Updated Files

1. **All Winston Logger Configurations**
   - `lib/rabbitmq.ts`
   - `lib/eventHandlers.ts`
   - `lib/consumerService.ts`
   - `lib/email.ts`
   - `lib/invoice.ts`
   - `lib/rabbitmqConsumer.ts`
   - `lib/rabbitmq-simple.ts`
   
   **Changes**: Replaced direct Winston logger creation with `createLogger('service-name')` calls.

2. **`/app/api/startup/route.ts`**
   - Added serverless environment detection
   - Made consumer service import conditional
   - Added proper error handling for serverless environments

3. **`/app/api/orders/route.ts`**
   - Made RabbitMQ service import dynamic
   - Added conditional event publishing based on environment
   - Prevents logger initialization issues

## How It Works

### Logger Factory Pattern
```typescript
const createLogger = (serviceName: string) => {
  const isServerless = process.env.VERCEL === '1' || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
  
  const transports = [consoleTransport];
  
  if (!isServerless) {
    // Add file transports only in non-serverless environments
    transports.push(fileTransports);
  }
  
  return winston.createLogger({ transports });
};
```

### Dynamic Imports
```typescript
// Only import RabbitMQ services when needed and in appropriate environments
const isVercel = process.env.VERCEL === '1';
if (!isVercel || process.env.RABBITMQ_URL) {
  const { default: rabbitMQService } = await import('@/lib/rabbitmq');
  // Use the service
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Serverless Compatibility**: All services now work in Vercel's serverless environment
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Services fall back to console logging in serverless
3. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
4. **Better Error Handling**: Proper error handling for different environments
5. **Performance**: Dynamic imports reduce bundle size and initialization time

## Environment Detection

The system detects serverless environments using:
- `process.env.VERCEL === '1'` - Vercel deployment
- `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` - Production environment

## Testing

### Local Development
- File logging works as before
- All services function normally
- RabbitMQ consumers can be started

### Production (Vercel)
- Console logging only
- RabbitMQ events are skipped unless explicitly configured
- All APIs work without filesystem dependencies

## Deployment Notes

1. **No Environment Variables Required**: The system auto-detects the environment
2. **Backward Compatible**: Works in both serverless and traditional environments
3. **Railway Consumers**: Separate Railway deployment continues to work with file logging
4. **Vercel Functions**: All API routes now work in serverless environment

## Monitoring

After deployment, check:
1. Vercel function logs for any remaining errors
2. Orders API functionality
3. Startup API response
4. RabbitMQ event publishing (if configured)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert the logger factory changes
2. The system will fall back to the original Winston configuration
3. File logging will work in non-serverless environments

## Future Considerations

1. **Centralized Logging**: Consider using external logging services (e.g., LogRocket, Sentry)
2. **Event Streaming**: For production, consider using Vercel's event streaming or external services
3. **Monitoring**: Add proper monitoring and alerting for serverless functions
